### Code Style Guidelines

Here are the basic style guides for all JS committed to the project. This will be evolving as new problems
are encountered, with both additions and subtractions. Before you commit, please make sure your
code meets these guidelines (and please feel free to raise new points and objections!):

1. ASI is used (due to the diligent efforts of the brilliant @sotiri) -- only used semicolons when actually needed.
2. Utilize camelCase (see what I did there?)
3. Tabs are 4 spaces.
4. Spaces come after the variable declarations.
5. All code must be ran through jshint before committing (with the settings defined in our repo)
